We focus on treating, curing and preventing some of the most devastating and complex diseases of our time. And we pursue the most promising science, wherever it might be found. RNAImmune discovers and develops innovative medical solutions to address important unmet medical needs in oncology, immunology, infectious diseases and vaccines. Our mission drives us. Our patients inspire us. We collaborate with the world for the health of everyone in it."
"ABOUT RNAimmune is a biotechnology startup in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology with more than 20 years’ expertise in handling and optimizing this versatile molecule for medical purposes. The principle of RNAimmune's proprietary technology is the use of mRNA as a data carrier to instruct the human body to produce its own proteins capable of fighting a wide range of diseases. The company applies its technologies for the development of cancer therapies, antibody therapies, the treatment of rare diseases, and prophylactic vaccines."
"OUR SCIENCE mRNA Design Platform We’ve developed a synthetic biology based, artificial intelligence aided platform that help us design better mRNAs to invoke the optimal response from our immune system. Current projects that are enabled by our platform include multi-target prophylactic vaccines and cancer vaccines expressing tumor-targeted epitopes. Proprietary Delivery Using our proprietary Polypeptide Lipid Nanoparticle (PLNP) based carrier, we are able to deliver a wider variety of mRNAs with enhanced intracellular expression. Self-amplifying mRNA Our novel self-amplifying mRNAs provide stronger and longer potency for each treatment."
FOCUS AREAS Infectious Diseases We develop prophylactic vaccines to help immune systems build responsive mechanisms against serious infectious diseases. Immuno Oncology We develop individualized neoantigen based therapeutic vaccines to treat cancer. We also provide early detection and companion diagnosis Rare Diseases We develop mRNA-based therapeutics to treat difficult rare diseases.
